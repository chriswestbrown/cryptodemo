CryptoDemo
----------
CryptoDemo is a dynamic web page that is used to provide an
interactive STEM module about basic symmetric encryption.




PERSONAL NOTES
SetSAIL - February 2021

Logistics:
40minute sessions, online, via zoom.  Expect 25 teachers per session?

Main idea:
My idea is to do an encryption module, but do it better!
Specifically, I'd like to get the secret key encryption idea across,
along with attacks and an understanding of some basic important issues
in cryptography, and I'd like to have some tie-in to the modern world,
and maybe a teaser for something else.  Finally, I'd really like to tie
in the idea of *function* in a way that hopefully expands students
understanding of what's going on.

- key size
- block-size?

- frequency analysis
- brute force
- chosen plaintext?
